## 🎯 Common Tasks

### Task: Re-subscribe payment status for a specific order

The `usePaymentStatus(merchantId, orderId)` hook automatically unsubscribes the previous channel and subscribes to the new one when `orderId` changes.

```typescript
import { useState } from "react";
import { usePaymentStatus } from "@/hooks/use-payment-status";

export const PaymentWatcher = ({ merchantId }: { merchantId: string }) => {
  const [orderId, setOrderId] = useState<string | undefined>(undefined);

  const {
    status,
    checkPaymentStatus, // optional manual re-check via API
    speakPaymentStatus,
    isPending,
    isCompleted,
  } = usePaymentStatus(merchantId, orderId);

  // Switch to a new order – hook will unsubscribe old and subscribe new
  const handleNewOrder = (nextOrderId: string) => {
    setOrderId(nextOrderId);
    // Optional: manually re-check current status from API after switching
    checkPaymentStatus();
  };

  return null;
};
```

Notes:

- Changing `orderId` triggers automatic re-subscription to the `merchantId` channel and listens for `payment_completed` for that specific order.
- Call `checkPaymentStatus()` if you want a one-off API refresh in addition to the realtime subscription.

### Task: Add toast notifications

**File:** Any component file

```typescript
// 1. Import the hook
import { useToast } from "@/hooks/use-toast";

// 2. Use in component
const MyComponent = () => {
  const { success, error, warning, info } = useToast();

  const handleAction = () => {
    try {
      // Your logic here
      success("Action completed!");
    } catch (err) {
      error("Action failed");
    }
  };
};
```

**Reference:** [TOAST_SYSTEM.md#basic-usage](./TOAST_SYSTEM.md#basic-usage)

---

### Task: Add a new protected route

**File:** `app/_layout.tsx`

```typescript
// 1. Get your condition
const { showNewFeature } = usePreferences();

// 2. Add to rules array
const protectionRules: RouteProtectionRule[] = [
  // ... existing rules
  {
    paths: "/new-feature",
    condition: () => showNewFeature,
    redirectTo: "/(main)/balance",
    reason: "New feature is disabled",
  },
];
```

**Reference:** [ROUTE_PROTECTION_EXAMPLES.md#quick-start](./ROUTE_PROTECTION_EXAMPLES.md#-quick-start)

---

### Task: Add analytics tracking

```typescript
{
  paths: "/premium",
  condition: () => isPremium,
  redirectTo: "/upgrade",
  onProtected: (path) => {
    analytics.track("premium_access_blocked", { from: path });
  },
}
```

**Reference:** [ROUTE_PROTECTION_EXAMPLES.md#3-with-analytics](./ROUTE_PROTECTION_EXAMPLES.md#3-with-analytics)

---

### Task: Protect multiple routes with same condition

```typescript
{
  paths: ["/admin", "/(main)/admin", "/admin/settings"],
  condition: () => isAdmin,
  redirectTo: "/",
  reason: "Admin access required",
}
```

**Reference:** [ROUTE_PROTECTION_EXAMPLES.md#1-multiple-paths-same-rule](./ROUTE_PROTECTION_EXAMPLES.md#1-multiple-paths-same-rule)
